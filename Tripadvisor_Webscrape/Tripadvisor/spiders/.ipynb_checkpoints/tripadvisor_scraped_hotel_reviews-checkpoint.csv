Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,Awful...,"Its hard to find words that can describe this experience without being too dismissive so i'll keep it short.  Pros. - Check experience was fine.... The checkin clerk was funny and helpful, and had a lovely manner with the guests. Very efficient. - Location... Very well set for access to Gatwick airport, with a short walk to the terminal for your flights.  Cons - Food...  the hotel not only was packed full and the restaurants were full, but the food itself was incredibly poor and expensive.   We did the buffet... on the evening.... barely anything was truly good tasting..... AVOID - Comfort... Hiltons of late seem to be less and less comfortable, the rooms stark... and without any character. Not the cleanest of rooms either. - its a big hotel.... everywhere is a lengthy walk and"," its just all a bit 'run down'  Poor food, not the best night sleep, expensive for what it is, tired and in need of significant change.  AVOID!","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,Great start to hokidat,"Staying in a hotel that’s part of the airport itself ie no tedious and expensive shuttle buses is integral to my coping strategy for early morning flights.  So staying at the Gatwick Hilton was a no brainer for our recent departure from south terminal.  Lots of other passengers seem to share this view as we arrived at a busy time.  But we didn’t have to wait long because after checking in on line our key cards had been prepared in advance and given to us whilst in the queue - a great idea.  The hotel has all the usual Hilton brand values - well equipped, spacious rooms, quiet and efficiently run.  We had a nice dinner in Amy’s restaurant which also has a welcoming bar.  All in all a v pleasant hotel that we would be happy to return to.",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,A good overnight stay!,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for one night before flying out to Costa Rica on holiday.  As well as booking a room, I booked a Meet and Greet at the hotel for the car, and Ace Parking were there when we arrived to take the car away for the duration of our holiday.  This is such an easy way to combine a room and parking.  The hotel has 821 rooms, spread over six floors. There are eleven different types of room, so there is plenty of choice depending on your budget. I chose a twin guest room, but when booking in online, I was offered a deluxe twin room which I was happy to take.  We occupied Room 7012, that has an interconnecting door to the room next door if you require a family room. The level of decoration in the room was very good, and it also had a free security safe,"," flat-screen TV (with a huge selection of TV channels), tea/coffee making facilities, fridge (but no mini-bar), easy to use air-conditioning which was effective, cupboard for hanging clothes (with five clothes hangers), plenty of clothes drawers, excellent wi-fi, two pillows on each bed with extras available, a trouser press, ironing board and iron and a phone in the bedroom and bathroom.  We could only find three plug points for charging mobile phones, ipads, etc. The bathroom had a bath and shower, a washing line for drying clothes, a toilet, large basin, a weighing scale, and Crabtree and Evelyn body products, and a hairdryer. As befits a hotel of this calibre, the facilties were impressive with a fitness centre, executive lounge, business and conference centres.  There is a choice of two restaurants and two bars (which both served food) - one of the bars shows key sporting events on screens.  Costa Coffee has an outlet very close to reception.  There is also paid private parking nearby. One of the big benefits of the hotel is the covered walkway to the South Terminal at Gatwick, which is about a ten minute walk.. This is a superb hotel, with comfortable rooms and facilities and within an easy walking distance directly into the South Terminal.","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,Satisfactory one night stay,"One night  stay which turned out to be much better than expected.Waited in the never ending queue to check in, a young guy enquired if we would like him to check us in, why not , thanks . The gentleman turned out to Mohamed who worked on the priorty desk, who in fact couldnt do enough for us , even gave us a recently refurbished room. Room was bright and spotless, tea and coffee facility , bed was comfortable , lots of extras in the shower room, what more could we wish for . Considering the money we paid this was a good start to our holiday. With a 5/6 minute walk to the terminal it didnt get any better. We skipped  the £18 pp breakfast as we felt we couldnt do it justice. Bar prices once the discretionary  service charge was added were a little on the high side .But its London,"," so higher prices are expected. Overall a very nice stay, and thanks again to Mohamed for making it more enjoyable , you're a credit to the company.","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,"Still nice but looking a bit sad, old and dated","We had an executive room and even these are starting to look a bit old and tired. That said still a very nice room.    We had a problem in that literally every time we moved the bed frame creaked really loudly, so we both had a rubbish nights sleep as every time one of us moved it woke us up.  I mentioned it at checkout and got the impression of little interest and it probably hasn’t been dealt with,  with all he said being “oh, we’ll look into it”   The above said there does appear to be some building work going on so hopefully this is a modernisation programme, as we love staying at this hotel.",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

Hilton London Metropole,Terrible ,"Absolutely terrible. Cracked ceiling, tiny room, bad quality tv, cracked paint on bath, shower coming of the wall, dated bathroom, sink tap falling apart, scratches all over the wall,really dated bathroom and nothing like the photos on there website show. Most importantly NO SOAP at a time like this!!!.   The lobby is really nice and food was lovely but the rooms are such aet down and the hallway to the room smelt of smoke all day and night.

Hilton London Metropole,Hilton,"Me and my sister stayed at the Hilton metropole on Saturday 14th March. Pleasantly surprised at the size of the hotel and how well kept the reception was kept. We was able to get into our room earlier than expected which was good. We dropped our bags off and came back for a bite to eat and to have a shower ready to go watch pretty woman. We ordered room service - pepperoni pizza, crinkle cut chips and 2 cans of lemonade. When the food arrived, the pizza was only cheese and tomato, no pepperoni and the chips where straight cut. My sister rang down to let them know and they offered to waiver the tray charge and give a slight discount. Which we was happy with. After we had eaten I dried my hair using the hotels dryer and when I went to put it away got a huge shock from the plug,"," went through my finger to my elbow. Also when I was in the shower, the water emptied very slowly and ended up pouring over the sides.  When we was checking out on the Sunday we told reception of all these incidents and all the man said was “did you report any of them when they happened” which no we didn’t as we where heading out. There was no apology, nothing.  It’s a lovely hotel, but unfortunately looks can be deceiving. ","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Hilton London Metropole,Clean and tidy. Nice rooms ,We stayed here for a weekend away and used it as a great base to go to shows and explore.

Hilton London Euston,Perfect if You Need to go to Euston,I want to thank the hotel from saving me from a really stressful hotel situation (a flight cancelled from overseas).  I arrived to the hotel late and the staff could not have been nicer.  The room is big and comfortable and had all the amenities and good lightning.  The breakfast was great - easy to get into and the food was good.  I was particularly impressed with the manager and staff - clearly well trained in the Hilton way and I highly recommend.,,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Hilton London Euston,Hotel Central e Qualidade+,Good hotel and well located in London because is very closed to Euston Train / Tube Station. Price paid a bit higher but within the average of the quality and brand offered. Room a bit small (double room) for work but very comfortable and internet was ok ,,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Hilton London Euston,Sad cold shower,Nice hotel overall but having lukewarm weak shower is not an energizing way to start ones day. The location was ok. Staff were nice and the room clean - but that shower really was a bummer. Sorry about that. ,,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Hilton London Euston,Weekend in London,"Stayed with Family on Short Holiday. Cant beat location, walking distance from St Pancras(we took train from Midlands). Euston and other tube options within close walk. Room sizes great for London, breakfast was decent. We were Hilton Gold so breakfast included, if paying for breakfast there are many cheaper and good options nearby. Great service by staff, recommend for a weekend in London.

Hilton London Croydon,Birthday Breakfast,"Four of us on the wrong side of 60 went for a birthday breakfast in the Larder Restaurant.  It was one of the nicest breakfasts I have had in a long time.  It catered for every taste.  There was a small selection for those with who needed a  Gluten Free Diet( our friend was a Celiac so he was very happy).  All the eggs were cooked to order in full view of the guests .  I asked for fried bread and they were only too happy to do it specially for me.   There was a Continental Breakfast selection, plenty of fresh fruit , yogurts ,  cereal and all the usual breads etc. The Manager was full on and very aware of what was going on,  and made sure we were aware of how the buffet worked.  The other staff were all smiles, helpful and kept us well   supplied with tea and coffee at the", table.  I think there was one trainee who looked very nervous but he really did try to do what was expected of him.   It is not cheap for those not on an expense account but worth every penny in my view.  We all said we would go back again ,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Hilton London Croydon,"Genuine welcome, super hotel","I stayed again for just one night on a business trip and was welcomed with genuine care for my comfort. As a Diamond Member I was thanked for my loyalty, had a lovely refurbished room, enjoyed a really nice meal and great night's sleep. Breakfast and checkout was seamless and the Porter team were very helpful with my luggage/work equipment. A team of Hilton ambassadors. ",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

Hilton London Croydon,Fabulous overnight stay,"Fabulous overnight stay We booked this hotel as we were invited to a birthday party in London.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,"Pretty good hotel, great location","We chose the Doubletree as it was in a great location and close to where our daughter was studying abroad.  the hotel is nice, the rooms clean and the breakfast was very good, though the coffee service was a bit slow and the omelette station seldom manned.  I didn't find anything specifically wrong here, but it seems like little things cold make it much better.  The hotel bar service was slow..even on a slow night when I was the only person at the bar.  Our room, a deluxe room was super far from the lobby.  The location and the closeness to tube stations, pubs, restaurants and museums.  I like Hilton properties and would stay here again when in London",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,Fabulous,"Excellent welcome. Fantastic quiet room, really clean. Best breakfast ever with lots of choice and attentive, friendly staff at all times. Nothing too much trouble. Just round the corner from the British Museum. Will definitely return.",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,Good location for a museum visit,"The ”deluxe premium” room we had offered the amenities you would expect a hotel this type. We found the room very clean. The bathroom floor was cold (no underfloor heating) and there was no towel rack. Soundproofing wasn’t very good, there was noise from the corridor and other rooms. Fairly good breakfast. The British Museum and the Holborn underground are only two blocks away",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,Great location,"Nice large rooms in a fantastic location close to numerous bars and restaurants. Only complaint would be a sign in the room saying contents of minibar are free with our compliments. Opened the minibar and found it completely empty!! No tea making facilities in the room, only coffee maker",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,Nice but could nicer,"I’m a bit of a fan of Double Tree by Hilton in London. Have stayed at Westminster, Victoria and Islington.  West End Double Tree by Hilton is a little more tired than the others. Staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful.   Bedroom on the small side but well furnished if a bit tired. Had two showers on different days - on both days the water was barely above lukewarm.   Breakfast was up to the usual high standard in terms of quality, would have been better with warm plates for my full english. Would have liked grapefruit.   Would return depending on price and choice.",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,Good overnight stay- Ask for a refurbished room,"Stayed here overnight for a early morning flight out of South Terminal. Booked on the hilton website while on sale, so managed to get a very good price. I am a Diamond member, so got free breakfast which was good in the resturant. Since we were arriving late, could not use the lounge. Emailed the hotel before we arrived to see if they can move me to a refurbished room (which is on on a separte wing) and they responded promptly and they confirmed it 2 days before check-in. Room was good. Didn't mind the decor too much since there were some reviews saying it looked old. Yes, it is not very modern but it was perfectly fine.  Regarding other reviews about walking miles to get to the room- it was not a very big deal at all and did not think it was an issue since it was less then 2",…,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,Such an easy hotel,"We stayed here for one night before our flight back to Australia - which was brought forward very quickly thanks to the changing situation. The hotel is connected to the South Terminal, albeit a 5-8 min walk from the departure area and North Terminal  shuttle stop.   We arrived in unusual times when there were barely any people in the lobby area, the Costa was closed and so was one of the restaurants. Our room was clean and the beds were comfortable. It was great for a one night stay.   The bar in the lobby was open, so we ate dinner there, but there was unfortunately very little atmosphere as everything was so deserted.  The staff were all fantastic, and hopefully one day we will return when the hotel is back in full swing.",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,Excellent Location at LGW !!,"We stayed here before - liked it - and came again - good idea. The hotel  - first of all - can be easily reached from the Terminal - a definite advantage! Reception staff very friendly - and the team  - (Marita, Brigitta and Nawal ? ) in the Executive lounge is absolutely brilliant - very efficient - and we really enjoyed the service there - in the evening  - with great tasty appetisers - and in the morning - a superb breakfast - should the opportunity arise - we would definitely stay there again - although our flight departed from Heathrow . Rooms are clean - spacious and all amenities were of good quality - a great hotel for the night before your flight - relaxing - and I am sure not just before flights - but for other London stays as well - since connections to London are",…,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,Very overpriced,"We stayed there before an early flight, the room was in need of attention and was looking old.  Bar prices were very high, large G & T and a large Pinot Grigio was £27.50.  The main restaurant, Amys were selling a burger for £26.00 but in the Sports Bar downstairs you could have a choice of burgers for £16.00.  Staff in the Sports Bar were friendly though.  It says it is joined to the terminal, but in reality it is joined to the short stay car park and then you have to take the lift up one floor, walk across the road and then you are t the terminal.  We would DEFINATELY  not stay there again. ",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,Convenient before taking an early morning flight,"We stayed here overnight before taking an early morning flight. It has the great advantage that there is a covered walk from the South Terminal, so no waiting for transit buses. However, as with last time we stayed here, the signage from the terminal to the hotel is poor (signs going back to the terminal are fine). As the route took us along passages past deserted car parks, we were not totally confident we were going the right way, even though we had done it before. Once at the hotel, the reception staff were pleasant and efficient. Our room was spacious and comfortable, and well insulated from aircraft noise.",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

Hilton London Euston,Good value—especially for London,"We had two rooms at this hotel for two adults and three teenagers. The rooms were spacious, bathrooms were clean, check-in was efficient, the bar area was quaint and the service was good. Room service food and breakfast were adequate but not great. Food quality leaves a little to be desired. But the location of this hotel is incredibly convenient to both the underground and several train stations.

Front desk lady not helpful at all! This left me in a predicament financially taking £100 for a deposit when room was already paid in full up front 2 weeks before booking.

I booked a double room, which was spacious enough. I've seen people mention the single rooms and can imagine how small they must be. I would say it's a false economy as anything smaller than what I had wouldn't have been comfortable. Especially if you're from the US and used to the size of rooms you get there.

We went up and couldn’t find the reception it said staff only and even those doors were locked so we had to go back down the lift to where we started.   We used the phone to find out how to get to the reception and they told us.

The room wasn’t made up per 2 adults and 2 children as per the booking, the sofa bed should have been made up before arrival but we didn’t want the bother of arranging this so just shared the double beds, not ideal! The room had not been cleaned properly and was quite dusty, the TV didn’t have enough channels, and one of them didn’t work at all, the toilet paper was really cheap and the loo made a loud gurgling noise for ages after flushing, annoying when you’re trying to relax!

Hilton London Croydon,What a dive!,"The only positive thing I can say about my stay was that the staff were lovely. The room was a disaster. I had no cold water, faeces stained towels, dirt/dust and hairs in the room, and aircon that didn’t work. Breakfast was no better. One of the first down, and everything was burnt and cold. Real disappointment from the Hilton brand.",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Hilton London Croydon,Best Hilton we’ve stayed at in a while,We stayed at this Hilton after attending the races. Check in was great by Rachel we were informed we were in a refurbished room on the third floor. Room was lovely modern and extremely clean size was perfect and the bed was really comfortable. We ate in the restaurant and there was a nice choice of meals. The lady in the restaurant was fantastic as were the bar Staff and the food was nice . We went to the gym which was well equipped. Breakfast was superb great selection and staff were excellent. Not sure what the area has to offer as we didn’t venture out ,,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a lovely man who was very friendly and welcoming. He upgraded us to a junior suite which I was very happy about. The room was huge! We had a lovely, comfy double bed, two sofas and a table. The bathroom had a bath tub and a separate shower. The hotel was very clean and tidy. There are plenty of parking bags for £5 a night. Literally can’t complain about anything! I will definitely be returning soon. ",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

Hilton London Euston,Average hotel,First time staying in hilton hotel. We had an average experience. The room was pretty small. amenities given were small bottles of shampoo and soap. I saw a strand of hair on the bed. The comforter was not tucked in properly. The 2nd day bed was done much better. Staff was friendly and helpful. Plus point was it was near euston station. ,,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Hilton London Euston,Fantastic Hotel for King Cross area of London,"Having spent multiple weeks in London over the past year at various hotels, I can say that spent two weeks at this hotel and actually enjoyed both the hotel and the staff. It was a comfortable hotel, well kept, well maintained.  The maintenance people keep the hotel well maintained. And respond quickly if there are any issues.  The front desk personnel are personable and efficient. The dining room downstairs serves a very nice breakfast and the staff there are efficient and will take a moment to talk to you.  The only thing about the hotel that is odd, is the design....there appears to be a vast area of the hotel that is not being used and all of the rooms are laid out around that area.",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Hilton London Euston,"Stay away, you can’t trust them","Whether the prices are available on the bar or not realistically who reviews the price list before ordering a drink and £4.20 for a lime and soda, a 200ml bottle of soda at that, and a dash of lime is absolutely disgusting. Is this the most expensive half pint of lime and soda in the country? Having stayed at a number of Hilton hotels I will now avoid them like the plague. I refuse to stay again at a chain that intentionally drives prices so high with nothing but bottled mixers and charging that level of mark up flies preposterous.",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Hilton London Euston,Great base in London ,"Although we’re regular Hilton guests, we hadn’t visited their Euston property for a while.  On this trip it worked really well.  A room was available on arrival at noon (obviously this cannot be guaranteed and being midweek in January helped but it was v much appreciated anyway).  The room was well appointed and quiet.  Nice bar and good breakfast.  Staff friendly and attentive in all settings.  But the big selling point is location - obviously great for Euston station (especially the sleeper service to Scotland as you can leave your bags there after check out).  The Eurostar terminal is just up the road.  Several buses take you into central London right from the hotel’s front door.  All in all a great base to explore London.

Hilton London Euston,Only sty here if nothing else is available in london,"The staff did not seem to be engaged or interested, the room was so small that I now know what a coffin feels like.

Amenities outside the hotel prior to arriving were plenty of coffee shops, pizza restaurants and a local Sainsbury's just opposite.    Reception area is nice and decorated well. Upon early arrival we were given the choice to  upgrade at a discount to a King Deluxe and we duly obliged.  Once checked in 2 Warm Gooey Cookies were given to each of us which was a lovely touch.   Best thing about the hotel was the room that we were upgraded to.  Generously sized and very modern finish, with clever use of design.

Had to ring for an extension lead and have my electric appliances in the bathroom to get ready.  Constant whirring noise all night and did not sleep from fans at the back of hotel.

During this stay I was upgraded to a King Junior Suite, which made my stay even more pleasant. Depending on the date, staying in this hotel is not expensive at all (especially when comparing to other hotels in the same area).

Hilton London Metropole,Good location for a visit to London but rooms are a bit tired,"We stayed at the Hilton London Metropole located on the Edgeware Road, Saturday 7th to Sunday 8th March.  We were there for a family get together and a birthday, consisting of three couples, booking three Executive Rooms. Arriving from Somerset to Paddington Station it was an easy flat walk to the hotel, taking about twelve minutes.  We had trouble spotting the entrance and walked right by the hotel and around the following road coming back in another direction and eventually found the entrance.  We arrived quite early, around 12.30pm and queued at check-in.  We were pleased that our room was ready.  We were all located on the fourth floor.  We did not check in all together, but strangely one of our group were given two bottles of water on arrival and another two the next day. ",…,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,Worst sleep ever,"Stayed here for one night with my wife as a stopover on the way back from holiday and left very disappointed.We were given an executive room on the far side of the hotel which we were told was an upgrade.The room was clean enough but only had one bath towel so we had to share after showering.The main issue was the bed,every time either of us moved or turned over or even just sat on the bed the creaking noise was horrendous and kept us both awake all night.When we got to reception to check out the girl asked if we enjoyed our stay I reported the bed and the response was “sorry about that,I will report it” and that was that! Not impressed.",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,Review,I stayed at this hotel two years ago and again last night. Two years ago I filled the bath and the water was brown. The same thing happened again. I wouldn’t be that bothered but it’s the same water you fill the kettle with. Can’t be right. The room was tired. There was no two prong charger for my razor or tooth brush in the bath room. There were no number signs to my room. In fact reception sent me totally the wrong way. The only positive I can mention was the high quality breakfast.  The premier inn is better.,,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,Everything you need from an airport hotel,Good comfortable room which was ideal for our early morning flight from the South Terminal. The buffet restaurant was exceptionally good value for dinner with a wide range of choices excellently presented. At both checkin and checkout the reception staff were courteous and efficient. Being linked to the terminal meant that we were dropping our bags within 5 minutes of leaving reception. We will definitely stay again. ,,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

Hilton London Croydon,Getting better and needed to,The team at this hotel have always been good but have been let down by the tired bedrooms which desperately needed upgrading/renewing 10 years ago. As a result of this despite being a Diamond HHonors member I stopped staying here 3 months ago having clocked up 30+ nights in the prior 12 months and moved my custom to the Holiday Inn in Kingston.   I gave them another go this week and they are making much progress with the bedroom renovations. If you get a refurbed room they are now to the standard you'd expect. If you don't well you have been warned.   The team are just as good if not better probably as a result of seeing the investment going in around them.,,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

As always thanks to Derek, Camilia, Keisha and especially Anita on reception who arranges for my plates and cutlery for me and my son. All the breakfast crew.

Customer service skill training needed !! Our second encounter with the staff was at the bar , well what a piece of work ! Absolutely ignorant and rude , I’ve never experienced anything on this kind level before , nor have my work colleagues!

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,Birthday Treats,"My fiancé and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate my 30th Birthday. We received a free upgrade to a deluxe room and there was a little cake, bottle of wine and birthday card in the room upon arrival. I found this personal touch to be most welcoming and kind of the staff.  When we arrived, our room was not ready so we left our bags with the hotel in a secure room, hassle free. The hotel is very close to Holborn underground station and the British Museum. We even walked to the theatre which was only a 15 minute walk away. Our room was cleaned daily, bed made, fresh towels daily and complimentary toiletries replenished.  I would recommend this hotel to friends. I had a lovely stay.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,In desperate need of a refurb!,"My husband and I chose to stay at the Doubletree in London thinking it would add a nice feel to our city break...how wrong we were. We have stayed at other Doubletrees before and have found the rooms to always be modern, at times on the small side, but generally very stylish and well fitted out. I’m not sure why Hilton has chose to neglect this location given it must be one of its most popular destinations and most expensive too. The room was tiny, the ‘double’ bed was not a double and was instead a 3/4 size (if that) and the decoration was a disgrace. It had an awful 19th century dated feel to it and the bathroom and shower facilities were very very poor. It’s incredibly disappointing to walk into a nice modern reception to check in but then find yourself in a cramped lift,",…,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

Level 4 is a dimly lit combination of plasterboard shuttered construction areas and guest rooms,the rabbit warren of corridors not helped by the additional hazard of discarded food trays left rotting in the hallways, it seems the Hilton GB5 tray charge for room service includes delivery but not collection, we eventually found our room.  On entering you are immediately transported back to the '80s, but not in a good way. Think tired furniture with mismatched knobs, carpet you dont want to walk on without wearing socks, minibar fridge on the floor of the wardrobe(?), dried blood on a pillow, obsolete 32"" TV and a bathroom with worn bathtub, badly grouted wall tiles, mastic sloppily applied over every wall joint and an over-bath shower head",…,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

I don’t drink, probably just as well, as the prices are extortionate!  We booked to have dinner downstairs in the restaurant.

Check in was swift and professional. The room was clean spotless. The view of 2 external walls was extremely depressing but the bonus was I had no noise from traffic so I could sleep at night.

Hilton London Euston,Night Manager Steven was a saviour!,"Having had the trains heavily delayed or cancelled from Euston back to Northampton I was left at 1am trying to find a hotel which had availability and was close by. I found on Booking.Com Hilton Euston to be available, I booked the room and headed straight to the hotel.  When I arrived Steven could't find my booking for the Thursday night , it was however at this point early hours of Friday morning and in my error had booked the room for Friday check in rather than Thursday check in.  The Hilton was at that point fully booked with 2 rooms showing as late check in. I was nearly having to head back to Euston station and sleep on a bench but the fabulous Steven worked his magic and with 30 minutes power nap in reception Steven got me a room!!!!

Hilton London Croydon,Great Stay - Once Again,"We have stayed at this hotel many times over the past few years and have never been disappointed. This time we were lucky enough to have been allocated one of the newly refurbished rooms which was really good but would have been even better (in our opinion) if it had a bath instead of a shower. Breakfast, as usual cannot be faulted. Great choice of hot and cold food and all staff friendly and helpful. Evening meals can be a bit of a challenge in terms of where you actually sit (the restaurant was closed on our last 2 visits so we ate in the bar which wasn't a problem) Can be a long wait if they have a party on.

Hilton London Croydon,Stay clear al- staff attitude appalling,"After completing 30 plus stays with HILTON this year, I’d like to think I know what basic good hospitality is and what you would expect from their staff.   It appears that revenue and poor guest service is at the top of their list, or so it is for guest relations manager Camila!   Upon my arrival it was evident that some function was taking place.  In my profile it does state “quite area & away from lift”. So naturally I would assume the hotel look at the guest requests.  Come 930pm, large amounts of vibration and music could be heard in my room. I went down to see Camila and said why is the music playing so loud. She said “they are allowed to play music until 10pm at that level”.

The rooms are well overdue for a complete refurb as they are tired and a bit tatty. Chilly too; extra blankets were provided without delay when we asked on our second day. Bar is underwhelming: not very experienced or friendly team manning it and running out of a standard gin. Breakfast is better than expected, given the other standards. For a Hilton hotel, it’s deeply underwhelming ",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,"Good location, that’s all","I stayed here whilst working in London, location is good as it’s walking distance to most places and easily accessible to Oxford St and Holborn Station, perfect for theatre goers! Arrival was fine and I was checked in by Stella, she was pleasant enough but staying in hotels frequently and travelling a lot for work I just find hotel receptionist generally robotic and impersonal. This was no exception! The room I got allocated 333 was next to the lift, I heard it all night especially when bags where dragged out. The room was reasonable for London and had everything you need. Bathroom again fine but no glass for a toothbrush or to use for mouthwash / water after brushing which is a bug bear.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,Surprisingly Great Hotel!,"We booked here due to its central location, which was fab We managed every where by foot as was close to Covent garden, Carnaby St and the theatre district.   We were not sure what to expect given all the negative reviews but we're pleasantly surprised. Check in was fast & friendly, we were upgraded to a beautiful room on 5th floor.  The room was huge, very newly decorated and had Nespresso, complimentary mini bar with soft drinks and snacks and patio doors.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,Must do better,"It grieves me to say this, but as a Hilton Honours Diamond member, the Doubletree by Hilton London West End falls way behind the standards I have grown to love travelling the world as I do.  The room wasn't exactly clean, the shower drain was blocked (I unblocked it myself), the minibar had just a small box of Pringles and some soft drinks (but was complimentary) and from the moment I walked in to this Hilton chain hotel, I felt my Diamond status meant nothing.  You see, it's normal for Diamond Status holders to check in through the Hilton Honours app and be issued with a digital key. I walk in, look at my app and get a message to report to reception.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,Perfect location ,This hotel is ideal for any theatregoers and is less than 5 mins walk to the nearest tube. The hotel itself is modern and the bar area and restaurant are both lovely. We had a family room which was a pull out sofa chair and a double bed. This was ok for our 9 year old but any older children may have struggled on it as it wasn’t very comfortable. My parents were in a queen room and it was very compact but to be honest when you’re in London you’re rarely in your room. Breakfast was gorgeous with a good range of choice and freshly made eggs and omelettes. The staff were really friendly and helpful and when we requested additional pillows they were there almost immediately. My only issue was the hot water in the bathroom was tepid at best even when left to run for a while to warm,…,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

Hilton London Metropole,We expected more.,"First impressions count - and the reception we got at check in left a lot to be desired.

Once we had checked in; we went to our room only to find that we had been given a room with two double beds, instead of the 3 single beds we had requested.

I get to the room and am completely shocked at the condition of it. I had gotten a feeing this hotel may be older because as soon as I got off the elevator, I saw how dated the carpets and furniture in the hallway were.  1. Room was extremely dirty with stains in the carpet and stains on the furniture (See pics) 2. Half the room had no lights, literally. Normally, there’s a floor lamp or something in one corner of the room, lamps on both night stands, and a lamp on the desk. At the very least maybe ceiling lights over the desk.

Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,Does the job,We booked and stayed at the Hilton South Gatwick for one night before a flight early the next morning. We had a bit of a queue for check in. We had a deluxe room and it was in what appeared to be the newer wing. Whilst we booked a double the room actually had 3 beds in it.   The corridors in the old section stank of old ness / mould and I’m glad we didn’t have a room them.   The beds were comfy and the room had what we needed.   We eat in the garden restaurant downstairs in the evening for dinner and breakfast. It was alright but not cheap and they added 12.5% service without checking.   I wouldn’t personally want to stay long at this hotel however it’s clearly designed for stop overs and it met our needs. ,,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

When we came back we decided to have a night cap but the lobby bar was very busy and no seating! I would like to say the utilisation of space needs to be looked into as a lot more tables could be fitted in to allow for guests to sit down. We had to take our drink and sit at a table at the Costa!! The room was one of the newly refurbished rooms and was clean and comfortable. Perhaps a look into pillows.

The passage way outside the lifts at bedroom level had a disgusting smell of damp and had patches of threadbare carpet.  Our room was dated to say the least - the dressing table chair seat was heavily stained, the bath was rusty and the towel ring was hanging off the wall.  Woodwork (door frames, etc.) was badly worn and damaged. In the restaurant we were quoted a waiting time of 40 minutes for a bog-standard steak and chips; the restaurant was only half full.

I was extremely unhappy when room service told me that they would charge me £5 for bringing up a fork. I raised this with the front desk and was told yes this is their policy.

We weren’t back in our room til 9.45 as a taxi receipt proved so unsure how noise was being made before we were there or as to how it was made even when we were back as we were watching the news & getting ready for bed when the call came from reception!

I said ""Ok then"". She replied back very rudely ""we're not matesl"" which left me feeling perplexed, shocked and astonished. In all the times I've stayed at a Hilton, I must say this the first time I've felt insulted by a member staff and thought that this was absolutely disgusting and shocking behaviour.

I was told I should have requested a double if I wanted something larger.  The hotel full and I could not get the upgrade I had accepted when offered it on line previously. However for the price including breakfast, it was OK if you can tolerate the small room..

When I arrived at the hotel the lady at reception informed me that I could not have a cot in the room as the room was too small. I was given the option of upgrading to a larger for £36 more. I felt  this was a deliberate attempt to up sell me a more expensive room. I declined the offer.  When entering the room there was no complimentary still water available as you would expect for a Hilton hotel. The room itself was located at the front of the hotel facing a busy room.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,Please stay,"First time to London and stayed at this hotel. Not sure if it’s a London thing or not, but the size of the room was very small compared to what I’m used to. I stayed in a Queen Superior room, so maybe the Premium rooms are better. In saying that, the room still worked, but would have been better with more wardrobe space and some drawers. Service at the hotel was really good, and the staff extremely helpful.

Hilton London Euston,Not great 10 years ago and no better now,"I stayed here many years ago with my family on our first-ever trip to London. While convenient to Euston Station and Kings Cross-St. Pancras, I remember staying in an old, small room with only average facilities. This was around 2010. I just stayed here overnight for business and it was no better. Some observations:  1. The Hilton Honors app indicated I could check into room 111, and it was available and would be ready as of 1 PM. So I did that and when I got to the hotel around 2 PM, they had just checked in someone ahead of me but told me my room still wasn’t ready.

We were upgraded to a suite, generously sized and very modern finish, with clever use of design.   Nespresso machine and complimentary mini bar was great. Two small bottles of wine, soft drinks and snacks all free!  If I had one other small complaint is the length of time it takes to get to the room from reception but I think it was due to a lift issue to the 6th floor.

Omar, a member of staff from the breakfast/restaurant team, was very attentive and pleasant to talk to. Not only did he have a beaming smile, he also ensured we individually enjoyed our meal.

One of our beds was not properly made and when I remade it, I discovered that the sheets were stained with what looked like blood. The bathroom was well-lit, but small, with very little space to put toiletries (either on the window sill or on a shelf above the toilet). One of the elevators was not working and the other one was tiny. Fortunately, we were on the first floor, so we just took the stairs.

Today, my room key was not working. I went back to the front desk (opposite side of the hotel). Discovered that they dis-activated it because my credit card was apparently not working in their system. To make it simple, I offered to pay now for the 3 nights (one more night to come).

There was a wait to get checked in and our room was basic. The biggest issue was that the bed was extremely uncomfortable and clearly needs a new mattress. The bigger issue was that the walls are so thin that we couldn’t get to sleep due to the neighbours talking until late. I dread to think how bad it could have been should they have been noisier!   We ate at the Garden Buffett restaurant at the cost of £46 for two. The food was mediocre at best and not value for money!

About 45 mins later, after our original waitress had disappeared, we were told they would be a wait for food. 10 mins later the food arrived. It was just about ok but not worth the wait.

My friends were staying in a room over looking the pool area so had a quieter room but the curtains did not fully cover the windows so there was a lot of light coming through 24hours a day. Neither of us felt our rooms where exec as promised and bathrobes were missing from the rooms.  Lobby and restaurant etc are kept very well and appear clean. However I think they are racing through the rooms to clean them and our bath had hairs in it.  Location is good for the tube access and",…,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Hilton London Metropole,Stayed with my Dad and Brother for a birthday treat,I liked this hotel although the beds were a bit creaky when you rolled over at night and the breakfast looked very expensive.The pool smelt a lot but I really enjoyed the amazing view.I had fun having a swim.but I really enjoyed my stay!!!,,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Hilton London Metropole,Not worth the price ,"I have stayed in quite a few Hilton hotels and I must say they continue to disappoint.   The two stars for this stay go to the location, its seven minute walk to London Paddington Station and approximately two minutes walk to Edgeware Road Station. So if you are working in central london or are visiting as a tourist then great this location gets the two stars.  As for the hotel like many other reviews and in fact other Hilton hotels this one is dated and in need of an urgent refit. The mattress was springy and quite frankly should have been replaced ten years ago, the door had mould around it, the carpet had so many stains in it I started to think it was the pattern when in fact it used to be cream coloured and it smelt terrible.  For £139 a night this is quite simply not worth",…,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Hilton London Metropole,My daughter’s birthday ,"I had a great time with my family staying at Hilton London Metropole, the staff was very helpful upon checking in and checking out, the room was very clean and the bed was very confortable, and the big surprise was excellent by preparing the cake for my daughter and delivered to the room, that was very kind of them. Breakfast was very good,The service was great on general. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family, and I will book again Hilton London Metropole on the future.",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Hilton London Metropole,Awful..am HHonors member & wouldn’t recommend,I am a Diamond HHonors member and I have never stayed in a worse Hilton before.  I am in a room which is no bigger than my box room at home.  The bath is the same size as a shower (why they insist on having a bath is beyond me).  I specifically asked for a room away from the lift and my room is right beside the lift.  There is no hairdryer and ironing board (I requested one from the “magic button” which didn’t work so I called “0”) - that was 45 minutes ago....the walls are paper thin but luckily my friend is in the next room so shouting through the walls works fine and I don’t have to phone her.   Check in was chaotic and not enough staff. So disappointed because I normally really enjoy staying at the Hilton chain hotels.,,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

Hilton London Croydon,Below Expectations,"RECEPTION Receptionist failed to inform us of breakfast times or how the lift required the use of our room key card in order to function.  THE ROOM Comfy large bed but soft saggy pillows. Safe and fridge provided. No information to be found re breakfast times, restaurant open times, its menu or prices or the local attractions. Generally dated e.g. fixed shower head, wonky toilet seat, minor sub standard repairs. The air conditioning (which was needed) was too noisy to use for any length of time.   THE RESTAURANT It was well below the standard one would expect from a Hilton hotel. To say that the menu was limited would be an understatement. Prices were exorbitant e.g. a non nondescript burger with chips (and only chips) cost £15 and a pint of lager was £5.34. We only ate here on",…,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Hilton London Croydon,Room needs an urgent refurb,"We did not check into our room until 7.30pm, therefore it was a quick case of offloading our bags and then heading out for food so it was not until the following morning did we notice the state of the room. As we were checking out that morning there was little point in complaining so i emailed the hotel on the 16/8/19 and to date I have still not had a reply. Below is a copy of the email which covers off this review !! Dear Sirs,  We stayed at the Hilton Croydon on 15/08/2019 ( Room 156 ). I am emailing to you give you some feedback on our stay.

Hilton London Croydon,A decline in quality and service,"Came last night to have a birthday dinner with my nephew and looking at a couple of coaches outside I knew the hotel would be busy. We tried to go to the main restaurant but were informed that we would be better off at the bar as the guests from the 2/3 coaches had occupied 80% of the seats at the Larder. So we sat the at the bar and for about 10 minutes and no one came. The bar itself was not that busy, I got fed up and asked for menus. Upon receipt I had noticed a lot of bar items had gone, for example the 3 mini beef burger sliders as well as the Club House Sandwich. My nephew had the pizza which was of decent quality and fair price. I had a portion of fried with hot wings. The waitress forgot to write down wings so this was not brought out till I enquired when the wings",…,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Hilton London Croydon,Woeful service,"Used the bar here yesterday following a family funeral, the service is non existent we spent £100 on 2 rounds of drinks and coffee you get no complimentary bar snack's not even peanuts no slice of lemon in the drinks hardly any Ice and tonic water from a tap not a bottle, and no smile no nothing.very disappointed.",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Hilton London Croydon,"Unsafe, and poor overall staff service",My handbag was stolen while having breakfast in the dining room. One manager showed absolutely no concern. The operations manager was helpful but it was clear no fuss was going to be made. They charged me in full despite the distress and inconvenience I faced throughout the trip. Getting their money was probably all they cared about. The overall staff service in reception and bar area was also sub-standard. The girl at the bar showed total disinterest when a friend and I went for drinks and dessert. Her overall service and attitude were poor.,,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,Beautiful hotel,"Lovely hotel, really liked the decor of the room. More than one tiny lift would be helpful though especially during check out.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,Excellent location slightly off the beaten path,"My husband and I are Hilton Diamond Members, so we were looking for a well-situated hotel in London that was reasonably priced for this city.  The DoubleTree London-West End fit the bill.    It is right on the Piccadilly line (blue), so we took the Tube straight from Heathrow Airport to Holborn which takes about 55 minutes.  To get out of the station, we had to go down about 20 stairs, then take 2 escalators up to street level.  The walk is about ten minutes from the Tube stop to the hotel with luggage.    We were upgraded to a Premium Deluxe Room which is at the back of the hotel and faces quiet Gloucester Street.  We were happy to have this room as it was spacious and comfortable.    A generous English breakfast was available in the basement level of the hotel. The selection",…,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,"Fine hotel - centrally located, professional staff","We chose this hotel because of the rates, location and the loyalty program (Hilton Honors).

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,Good room poor bathroom,"Good rooms and location, only downside is old bathrooms with poor quality shower attached to the bath.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End,"Right location, Wrong hotel","So, We took the train from the NorthWest of England to London for a tour of the sights with the kids and friends. Booking this hotel seemed to cover everything we needed or so we thought.  What a poor decision this turned out to be. Whilst the rooms are competitively priced on the internet,(That's the only good bit) Harry Potter had more room under the stairs in Privet Drive than we had !!!  Don't be fooled by the nice pictures in some of the reviews. It's a box room, hence the price. Double bed is a 3/4 bed, mold in the bathroom was almost growing mushrooms. Carpet was filthy and the room was tired. Needs a big overall.   What a shame, at the same time of visiting the hotel the lobby sprung a leak, well understatement. FLOOD... Reception flooded and dining area flooded,",…,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

Hilton London Metropole,Will not ever go back as dirty rooms,"The downstairs areas are exactly Hilton standard and the pool is lovely BUT The rooms were so dirty/old and needed urgent refurbishment in the tower, esp rooms 609/611.  We passed our concerns to management so hopefully the changes will be made, we were given a 25% discount to apologise after arrival home, as we couldn’t accept the offered free breakfast at the time. It wasn’t enough really as so grubby.  The reason at the time we couldn’t go and ask to change rooms was due to travelling with our autistic children as it would have been really difficult to have to return to reception with them.  The room issues:- dirty carpets, broken shower head, paint coming off of bath side, lime scale under taps, stale ?smoke smell in room and numerous wires at side of the fridge.

I did not realise that things could ever be so bad.  On arrival at approximately 2:30 pm only four of eight check-in desks were open.  They were queues and I waited.  Room 324 in the East Wing was allocated for my stay against Hilton Honors points. It was nasty.  The ceiling was damaged. The filthy curtains were detached from the track. There was mould growth on the ceiling, and it was otherwise black with dirt. The bedding was stained.   The carpet was stained in multiple places. Furniture was scratched. Printed material was torn.

Hilton London Metropole,Absolute disgrace,We stayed here in december myself and 3 kids in 2 rooms.  I have stayed In many hilton hotels around the world and have never came across such a disgrace of a hotel.  We had 2 rooms which we realised after getting back after a long day sight seeing that both rooms heating was broken and rooms were freezing.  Reported this to reception no one came to check so I had to go down myself to reception.  I then waited another 45 mins for engineer to appear which he advised could not be fixed I had a 4 year old son with me and was freezing.  That's not the only thing as I have attached pictures of this health hazard of a room absolute filthy and as for the bathroom was disgusting.

Facilities are average, but a telephone in my room didn't work, so I could not set a wake-up call. I could not get an alternative telephone at the front desk.",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Hilton London Euston,Tired Rooms not Worth the Rate,"This hotel is in a good location for the transport links and ion the face of it looks a nice hotel, or so I thought. Chose a family Superior room for the size and was disappointed, nothing like the photo on Hilton’s website, small, dark and shabby decor. It looked as though there had been water damage as all the skirting boards were splitting and flaking, noisy heating/cooling system which is a blower under the window and faulty lighting in the bathroom. Given the level of choice in London I wound have thought Hilton would be on top of things like this, I’m just sorry I cancelled my booking at Royal Horse Guards Hotel.",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

Hilton London Euston,Great rooms and breakfast,"We stayed at this hotel our our return from Paris, because it is in walking distance of St Pancras train station.  The hotel was clean, and the rooms were spacious.  The breakfast buffet is included for some guests, but not a part of our reservation.  However, it was very affordable and offered a variety of selections.  There were also some nice places to dine nearby.  My only complaint is that baggage must be carried up the front entrance and some steps in the hallway.  ",,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,"Location, location, location - and excellent staff","It’s all about location. That is, if you’re leaving from the South Terminal, which is just a few minutes walk away (all inside, so you don’t have to worry about the weather). If you’re leaving from the North Terminal, then there are other hotels that are much closer.  Not quite all about that. The staff are wonderfully efficient and friendly.  The hotel itself is brutally modernist and a bit the worse for wear. The central area, containing reception and some dining places, has all the looks and atmosphere of an aircraft hangar. We were given a newly refurbished room, which was quiet, clean but clinical. On the Friday night we were staying there, there were a lot of other travellers around, which led to queues and some difficulty in finding a place to have a quiet drink and meal.",…,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,Hotel is slowly getting worse and what is the 'service charge' for.,"Two visits one at end of November and another in January.

In November we checked in and we were told we would be in the new part of the hotel. We had stayed in that part before and it had been ok. This time the bed had a mattress cover on that every time you moved even a couple of inches it sounded like a huge pile of cellophane being squashed it was so loud. It made for a very noisy night!

Hotel Hilton London Gatwick Airport,Appalling ,"This is honestly one if the worst hotels I’ve ever stayed in. You expect the Hilton brand to deliver something more than your more ‘economy’ brands. You’d be very disappointed.   Literally everything makes this hotel substandard. The service, the HOUR long queue to check in, the lacklustre decor and the truly archaic rooms. No plug sockets, a shower that was unable to wash the shampoo from my hair, a toilet that didn’t flush, ancient and dirty yellowing furniture. Honestly disgusted.

Great location but there is little 4* experience to be had here. My room (605) was noisy from street traffic and when it rained outside it rained inside too.

No space for our luggage or clothes, plaster coming off the ceiling, the  bathroom created for a midget was swimming after my husband tried to take a shower. We asked for a bigger room and got a rude 'that's the room, that's the room' from the same unfriendly receptionist and there is nothing else available.
